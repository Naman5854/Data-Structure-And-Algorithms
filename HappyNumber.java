Conclusion for Happy Number Program:-
This program efficiently determines whether a given number is a Happy Number using Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm. It repeatedly calculates the sum of squares of digits until it either:

Reaches 1, confirming that the number is a Happy Number.
Forms a cycle, proving that the number is not a Happy Number.
Key Features:
# Uses slow and fast pointers to detect cycles efficiently.
# Runs in O(log n) time complexity due to repeated digit sum calculations.
# Works for both happy and non-happy numbers without infinite loops.

This approach ensures optimal performance while keeping the code simple and readable.
